# 💻 CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from **Harvard's CS50x 2025** course.

I’m using this repo to track my learning progress, build a public portfolio, and practice using Git and GitHub!

## ✅ Problem Set 0: Scratch – Memory Game

- 🎮 A simple memory game built using Scratch.
- 🧠 When a player clicks matching shapes, the score increases.
- ❌ If mismatched, the cards reset.
- 🏁 Game ends when all matches are found.
